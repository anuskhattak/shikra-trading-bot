# Specification Quality Checklist: ATR Calibration Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 13 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Out of Scope section explicitly excludes H4 bias (spec007) to prevent scope creep
- Assumptions section documents ATR period defaults, regime thresholds, and cache strategy
- Dependencies on spec001 (MT5 data), spec003 (lot calculator), spec004 (volatility filter) are documented
- Ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
